### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineering Student at UVic, University of Victoria. I enjoy programming and have a vast interest in a multitude of programming fields. I am currently working on a personal website using React and Typescript. An ongoing projects that I work on periodically is my Tetris Game (built in Java). Currently, I am in the Robotics Club and AI Club at UVic where I work on additional projects related to those fields.
