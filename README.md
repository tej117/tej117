### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineering Student at UVic, University of Victoria. I enjoy programming and have a vast interest in a multitude of programming fields. I am currently working on a python script for the Google Calendar API. Some ongoing projects that I work on periodically is my Tetris Game (built in Java), and my personal website. Currently, I am learning Godot since I also have an interest in making Video Games.
